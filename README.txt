This is a program written in C# that is designed to run in a Visual Studio environment.
This program demonstrates a basic understanding of cryptography and attempts to
decrypt a randomly generated password using a separate form than the login form.

Unfortunately, the decryption process is very long and memory consuming and does not work
on every device. Ultimately, I was only able to make the program work successfully and not
more efficiently.
